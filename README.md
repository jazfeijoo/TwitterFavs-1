# SOCIALFAVS

## Description

An app that lets you choose your top favorite accounts to show on your feed. All irrelevant content is removed so that you spend less time mindlessly scrolling! 

## Building 

npm install
npm init i concurrently

## Dev Test 

npm run dev

## Tech Stack 

* React framework for web applications
* React-Redux for state management
* Express.js for backend server routes 
* Concurrently to run backend and frontend separately
* Twitter Search API for accessing social account/feed data 


## Next Steps

* Add database (users, favlists)
* Implement user account security (login, sign-up, logout)
* Complete navigation bar routing 
* Add favlist component
* Add current feed component 

## Notes

I decided to create this web application because:

  1. I believe there needs to be a better solution for tackling the information overload issue without completely blocking off social media apps

  2.  I wanted to run the back-end and front-end separately in order to better understand their differences in terms of setup and bugs. 

  3. Lastly, I hope to continue to develop my skills (React, APIs, State management, Security) as a software engineer
