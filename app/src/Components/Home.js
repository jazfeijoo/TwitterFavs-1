                    <br></br>It could be that your timeline is full of irrelevant content that you scroll through everyday
                    <br></br>It could be that you don't want a hard cut off but you don't want the data overflow either
                    <br></br>What if there was a way to limit your daily feed to the content you actually want to see 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>This is what Social Favs is solving! Simply choose your favorite accounts for each platform
                    <br></br>Your daily feed will only show posts/content posted by your favorites (currently set at last 20 tweets, minus retweets!)
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>The goal of this app is help users weed out the content that they are fed on their social media accounts

                    <br></br>Saves stress: The amount of data we consume on daily basis cannot be healthy
